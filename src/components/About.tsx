        <p className='text-white text-900 pt-4'> Hello! I'm Muhammad Sami Asghar Mughal, a Pakistani student born on January 24, 2006, with a deep-rooted passion for cloud-enabled generative AI, Web3, and the Metaverse. My journey in tech is driven by a commitment to harness emerging technologies to build interactive and impactful digital experiences.

I'm skilled in TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Next.js, focusing on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly front-end applications. As an active participant in the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) and various hackathons, I continuously hone my technical abilities to stay at the forefront of innovation. Through my projects, which I share on GitHub, npm, and LinkedIn, I aim to engage with the tech community and inspire others to explore new possibilities.

My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry, exploring ways to leverage AI, Web3, and other technologies to solve real-world problems and enhance digital interactions.</p>
